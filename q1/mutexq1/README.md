Task 1 runs and turns on LED for 0.5 seconds and then task delays for 1 second at t = 0.5s
Task 2 runs at t = 0.5 seconds for another 0.5 seconds and task delays for 1 second at t = 1s
Task 3 runs at t = 1s and task delays for 1 second.
The next sequence would start at t = 1.5s hence the system was idle between t = 1s and 1.5s. 
The task sequence repeats continuously. 

In the output file, the first task runs at 240 ms hence the time values described above are offset by t + 240 ms.
